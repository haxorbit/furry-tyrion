Furry Tyrion
============

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/haxorbit/furry-tyrion.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/haxorbit/furry-tyrion)

**NOTE**: Requires Express 4.x / Not compatible with Express 3.x

-----------
Furry Tyrion is a very simple Express.js app for you to explore around and understand Express framework better.

It is a good project to start learning Express because it covers GET and POST requests, router, the Jade template engine, the Stylus CSS engine, basic authentication, and sessions. All of it while being a tiny project.
